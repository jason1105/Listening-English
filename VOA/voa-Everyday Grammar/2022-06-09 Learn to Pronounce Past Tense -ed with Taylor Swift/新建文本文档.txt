The English alphabet has only 26 letters, but there are over 44 sounds! This can be a problem for English learners.
Today on Everyday Grammar, we will learn about the past tense ending –ed for regular verbs. We will learn that it is pronounced differently depending on the letters it follows.
The suffix –ed is used to form the regular past tense of a verb or as a past participle ending. 
We use the past tense to talk about things happening before the present or about completed action.
For example:
I listened to music this morning at the gym.
I helped my neighbor water her garden.
I waited all day for my brother to call me.
These are all examples of the simple past tense of regular verbs. Did you notice any difference? Listen again to the way that each verb is pronounced.
Listened, Helped, Waited
The –ed ending of all three verbs sounds different. 
“Listened” has a /d/ sound at the end. “Helped” has a /t/ sound at the end. And “waited” has an /Id/ sound.
When we speak, air causes the vocal cords to move, producing sound. That sound can be changed using parts of our mouth and tongue to produce words.
If we produce a sound with our vocal cords, we create a vibration that we can feel. 
Place your hand on your throat while speaking to feel the vibration. These sounds are call voiced sounds. 
Voiced sounds include all vowels. In addition, the consonants /b/, /g/, /d/, /v/, and /z/ are voiced. So are /m/, /n/, /l/, /r/, /y/, /j/, and voiced /th/ sound, as in the word “the.”
For example, the verbs “roam,” “believe,” and “enjoy” end in voiced sounds.
Voiceless sounds do not use the vocal cords to produce the sound. So, you will not feel a vibration when you say them.
Voiceless consonants include /p/, /k/, /t/, /s/, /f/, /sh/ /ch/, and voiceless /th/ like in the word “teeth.”
Verbs that have voiceless sounds at the end include “watch,” “help,” and “laugh.”
We have three rules in English to help decide how to pronounce –ed endings for regular past tense verbs.
1. If the last letter of the regular verb ends in a voiced consonant or a vowel sound, pronounce the –ed ending as just /d/.
For example:
“Roam” … “Roamed” (/d/)
“Believe”…. “Believed” (/d/)
“Enjoy” … “Enjoyed” (/d/)
2. If the last letter of the regular verb ends in a voiceless consonant, pronounce the –ed ending as just /t/.
For example:
“Watch” …”Watched” (/t/)
“Help” … “Helped” (/t/)
“Laugh” …”Laughed” (/t/)
3. Finally, if the regular verb ends in either a “t” sound or a “d” sound, pronounce the –ed ending as /Id/ which creates a separate syllable at the end of the verb.
For example:
“Need” …”Needed” (/Id/)
“Want” …”Wanted” (/Id/)
“Decide” …”Decided” (/Id/)
Let us look at these rules in action with an example from a song by Taylor Swift called “Cardigan.” 
Try to hear the different ways Taylor pronounces the verbs with –ed as she sings!
[Singing...]
The first past tense verb is “needed.” We can hear that “needed” has an /Id/ sound at the end. That is because the verb “need” ends in a /d/ sound.
The next verb is “marked.” “Mark” ends in the voiceless consonant /k/. So the voiceless –ed ending /t/ is used.
Lastly, we have “tried.” The verb “try” ends in a vowel sound /ai/. All vowels are voiced, so use the voiced sound /d/ as our –ed ending.
Today we learned that the pronunciation of the –ed ending for regular verbs in the past tense changes. 
The correct pronunciation depends on the ending of the root verb. 
Different pronunciations are used if the root verb ends in a voiced sound, a voiceless consonant, or a /t/ or /d/ sound.
Here is a list of regular verbs. Can you guess how they are pronounced in the past tense?

And finally, listen to your favorite songs in English. If the song is in the past tense, can you hear which sounds are used for the regular past tense? Is it a /d/ sound, a /t/ sound, or an /Id/ sound?
You can share your written exercise in the comments below, but also try to say the sounds aloud!

英语字母表只有26个字母，但却有超过44种发音!这对英语学习者来说可能是个问题。
在今天的《每日语法》节目中，我们将学习规则动词的过去式结尾ed。我们将学习到，它的发音取决于它后面的字母。
后缀-ed用于构成动词的规则过去式或作为过去分词结尾。
我们用过去式来谈论发生在现在之前的事情或完成的动作。
例如:
今天早上我在健身房听音乐。
我帮邻居给花园浇水。
我等了我哥哥一天的电话。
这些都是规则动词一般过去时的例子。你注意到有什么不同吗?再听一遍每个动词的发音。
听着,帮助,等待着
这三个动词的-ed结尾听起来都不一样。
" Listened "后面有一个/d/音。" helping "结尾有一个/t/音。" wait "有一个/Id/音。
当我们说话时，空气使声带运动，发出声音。这种声音可以通过口腔和舌头的某些部位来改变，从而产生语言。
如果我们用声带发出声音，我们就能感受到震动。
说话时把手放在喉咙上感受振动。这些声音被称为浊音。
浊音包括所有元音。此外，辅音/b/、/g/、/d/、/v/和/z/都是浊音。还有/m/， /n/， /l/， /r/， /y/， /j/，以及浊音/th/，比如单词“the”。
例如，动词“漫游”、“相信”和“享受”以浊音结尾。
清音不是通过声带发出的。所以，当你说它们的时候，你不会感到震动。
不发音的辅音包括/p/、/k/、/t/、/s/、/f/、/sh/ /ch/和“teeth”中的不发音的/th/。
末尾有清音的动词包括“watch”、“help”和“laugh”。
我们有三条英语规则来帮助决定一般过去时动词结尾的-ed的发音。
1. 如果规则动词的最后一个字母以浊辅音或元音结尾，以-ed结尾的字母发为/d/。
例如:
“Roam” … “Roamed” (/d/)
“Believe”…. “Believed” (/d/)
“Enjoy” … “Enjoyed” (/d/)
2. 如果规则动词的最后一个字母以清音辅音结尾，以-ed结尾的音发成just /t/。
例如:
“Watch” …”Watched” (/t/)
“Help” … “Helped” (/t/)
“Laugh” …”Laughed” (/t/)
3.最后，如果规则动词以“t”音或“d”音结尾，将-ed发成/Id/，这样就会在动词结尾形成一个单独的音节。
例如:
“Need” …”Needed” (/Id/)
“Want” …”Wanted” (/Id/)
“Decide” …”Decided” (/Id/)
让我们以泰勒·斯威夫特的歌曲《Cardigan》为例来看看这些规则的实际应用。
试着听一下泰勒唱歌时带-ed的动词的不同发音方式!
(歌声……)
第一个过去式动词是“needed”。我们可以听到“needed”在末尾有一个/Id/音。这是因为动词need以/d/结尾。
下一个动词是" marked "。“Mark”以清音/k/结尾。所以要用不发音的-ed结尾/t/。
最后是“tried”。动词“try”以元音/ai/结尾。所有的元音都是浊音，所以用浊音/d/作为我们的-ed结尾。
今天我们学习了规则动词过去时结尾-ed的发音变化。
正确的发音取决于动词词根的结尾。
如果词根动词以浊音、清音或a /t/或/d/结尾，则会使用不同的发音。
这是一组规则动词。你能猜到它们过去时的发音吗?
Mix, Play ,Repeat, Cook, Gather
最后，听你最喜欢的英文歌曲。如果这首歌是过去时，你能听出哪些声音是用于一般过去时的吗?它是一个/d/音，一个/t/音，还是一个/Id/音?
你可以在下面的评论中分享你的书面练习，并且试着大声朗读!
