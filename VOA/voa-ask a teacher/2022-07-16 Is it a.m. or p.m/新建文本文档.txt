Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher, we will answer a question from Max in China about the difference between a.m. and p.m.
Dear VOA teachers, This is Max from China. 
During a listening exam I heard a saying like this, “The incident happened on the 400 block of Rutland Road just after 12:30 PM,” and it was described as midnight. 
I’m confused. I think that 12:30 PM should be at noon during the day, and if I want to say the time of midnight I think AM is correct. 
Which one is right? Thank you for helping me solve this problem. Best regards, Max
Dear Max, Thank you for writing to us.
You are correct! 
In the United States, we do not use a 24-hour clock in day-to-day speech. But some special fields that demand very clear communication use a 24-hour clock. 
So, you might hear a person describe such time as “military time.” A 24-hour clock is more commonly used internationally than it is in America.
We use a 12-hour clock and abbreviations from Latin to tell time, a.m. (ante meridiem, meaning before midday) and p.m. (post meridiem, meaning after midday).
Our morning clock starts at 12:00 a.m. That is 0:00 (zero hundred hours), or midnight, internationally.
Morning, or a.m. hours, go until 12:00 p.m., which would also be 12:00 on an international, 24-hour clock.
But most of the time, we do not show a difference between the two forms of timekeeping in everyday speech. 
For example, we know that, if a friend wants to meet at 2:00 local time, hopefully they do not want to meet at 2:00 in the morning.
Let us look at a few examples to compare times.
My supervisor planned the meeting for 3 p.m.
This means that the meeting will take place at 3:00 in the afternoon.
That new superhero movie is so long; it lasted until 1 a.m.
This means that the movie did not finish until 1:00 in the morning (after midnight).
I have an evening class from 4:30 p.m. until 7:00 p.m.
This example means that the class continued from the afternoon into the evening.
Now, consider a clock for comparison.
If you are reading online, we have a clock to help us understand the differences between the 24-hour clock and the 12-hour clock.
The clock is at 10:10. If it is the morning we would say it as 10:10 a.m. This would be the same internationally.
But, if it were before midnight, we would read it as 10:10 p.m. or 22:10 on a 24-hour clock.
A fun way to remember a.m. and p.m. is to listen to the song AM to PM by singer Christina Milian.
The lyrics go:
“Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
People gettin' down, that's right, from AM to PM”
In the song, the party is starting in the early hours of the morning (after midnight) in the a.m.
And the party is so long that it goes into the afternoon, or the p.m. hours.
Please let us know if these examples and explanations have helped you, Max!

你好!在本周的“有问必答”节目中，我们将回答来自中国的Max提出的关于上午和下午的区别的问题。
亲爱的美国之音老师，我是来自中国的Max。
在一次听力考试中，我听到了这样一句话:“事故发生在拉特兰路400号街区，刚刚过了12:30，”当时被描述为午夜。
我困惑。我认为12:30应该是白天的中午，如果我想说午夜的时间，我认为AM是正确的。
哪一个是对的?谢谢你帮我解决这个问题。送上诚挚的问候,Max
亲爱的Max:谢谢你给我们写信。
你是正确的!
在美国，我们不会在日常交谈中使用24小时制。但是一些需要非常清晰的沟通的特殊领域，会使用24小时制。
所以，你可能会听到一个人把这样的时间描述为“军事时间”。24小时制的时钟在国际上比在美国更常用。
我们用一个12小时制的时钟和拉丁语的缩写来表示时间，a.m. (ante meridiem，意思是正午之前)和p.m. (post meridiem，意思是正午之后)。
我们的晨钟从12点开始。在国际上是0:00(zero hundred hours)，也就是午夜。
早上，或者说上午的时间，一直到中午12点，这在国际24小时制中也是是12点。
但大多数时候，我们在日常用语中并没有区分这两种计时方式。
例如，我们知道，如果一个朋友想在当地时间2点见面，希望他们不想在凌晨2点见面。
让我们看几个例子来比较时间。
我的主管把会议安排在下午3点。
这意味着会议将在下午3点举行。
那部新的超级英雄电影太长了;一直持续到凌晨1点。
也就是说，电影直到凌晨1点(午夜后)才结束。
下午4点半到7点我有一节夜校课。
这个例子意味着课程从下午一直持续到晚上。
现在，考虑一个时钟来进行比较。
如果你正在网上读这篇文章，上面有一个钟表来帮助我们理解24小时钟表和12小时钟表的区别。
钟表是10点10分。如果是早上，我们就说 10:10 a.m.。国际上也是如此。
但是，如果是在午夜之前，我们会把它读成 10:10 p.m. 或者24小时制的 22:10。
记住上午和下午的一个有趣的方法是听歌手克里斯蒂娜·米利安的《AM to PM》。
歌词:
“有人把灯关掉，这样我们就可以不分昼夜地摇滚了
人们都来了, 从早上到下午。”
在这首歌中，派对在凌晨(午夜后)开始。
聚会时间很长，一直持续到下午，或者下午几个小时。
如果这些例子和解释对你有帮助，请告诉我们。
