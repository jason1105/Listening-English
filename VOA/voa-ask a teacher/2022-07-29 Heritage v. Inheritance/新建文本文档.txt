Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher, we will answer a question from Noura about the difference between “heritage” and “inheritance.”
Hi VOA learning team,
Would you please help me to understand the difference between “inheritance” and “heritage?” And in which situations we use each of them?
Thanks, Noura.
Dear Noura, Thanks for this question!
“Heritage” and “inheritance” are similar words. They are both nouns, and share some meaning. Both represent something passed down through generations.
The big difference in these two words is how we use them and their associations.
Let’s start with “heritage.”
Heritage can be property, traditions, customs, or culture passed down through generations. “Heritage” is something you get just by being born.
Heritage is tied to the history of a person, group or nation.
For example, many Americans who are born in the U.S. have heritage from other countries.
I have Italian heritage, for example. My great-grandfather was born in Italy. But, I was born to Americans in the United States, so I have American heritage also.
Another example is when we talk about language:
Heritage speakers of a language learn the language from talking to their parents at home instead of just at school.
“Inheritance” can be an action or a thing. 
It is something passed down by one person to another, usually through death. Often this is property or money from a family member, like in this example.
My inheritance from my grandmother includes a little house on the coast.
But, inheritances are not always welcomed! Listen:
My inheritance from my new job is an old, dirty office.
And a brief note on the word “inherit.” Inherit is a verb. It can mean either receiving something from someone at birth or when someone dies.
When you are born, you receive or inherit physical and mental traits from your parents or ancestors. Like in these examples:
She inherited her blue eyes from her father.
I inherited my father’s poor eyesight.
We can also use inherit in the same way we talk about inheritance, but as a verb.
The brothers will inherit their mother’s house when she dies.
Please let us know if these examples and explanations have helped you, Noura!

你好!在本周的“有问必答”节目中，我们将回答诺拉提出的关于“heritage”和“inheritance”的区别的问题。
嗨，美国之音学习团队，
你能帮我理解一下“inheritance”和“heritage”的区别吗?我们在什么情况下使用它们呢?
谢谢,Noura。
亲爱的诺拉:谢谢你的问题!
“Heritage”和“inheritance”是类似的词。它们都是名词，有相同的含义。两者都代表着代代相传的东西。
这两个词的最大区别在于我们如何使用它们以及它们的联系。
让我们从“heritage”开始。
heritage可以是代代相传的财产、传统、习俗或文化。“heritage”是与生俱来的。
Heritage与一个人、群体或国家的历史息息相关。
例如，许多在美国出生的美国人都有来自其他国家的遗产(Heritage)。
比如，我有意大利血统。我的曾祖父出生在意大利。但是，我是在美国出生的，所以我也有美国血统。
另一个例子是当我们谈论语言时:
使用传统语言的人在家里与父母交谈来学习语言，而不仅仅是在学校。
“Inheritance”可以是一个动作，也可以是一个东西。
它是由一个人传给另一个人的东西，通常是通过死亡。通常这是来自家庭成员的财产或金钱，就像这个例子。
我从祖母那里继承的遗产(Inheritance)包括海边的一所小房子。
但是，遗产(Inheritance)并不总是受欢迎的!听:
我新工作留给我的遗产(Inheritance)是一间又旧又脏的办公室。
还有一个关于"Inherit"这个词的简短说明，Inherit是一个动词。它可以是指从某人出生时或去世时收到某物。
当你出生时，你从父母或祖先那里接受或继承(inherit)了身体和精神上的特征。比如下面这些例子:
她从父亲那里继承(inherit)了一双蓝眼睛。
我继承(inherit)了父亲视力不好的毛病。
我们也可以像谈论继承(inheritance)一样使用inherit，但它是一个动词。
母亲死后，兄弟俩将继承(inherit)她的房子。
请让我们知道这些例子和解释是否对你有帮助，诺拉!
