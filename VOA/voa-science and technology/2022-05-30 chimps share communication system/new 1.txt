Study Shows Chimps Share Complex Communication System 

Scientists who study the evolution of language say wild chimpanzees have a more complex communication system than past research has shown. 
The researchers say the animal uses more than ten kinds of calls that can be combined into hundreds of different orders or sequences.  
The study team made 4,800 recordings of calls produced by members of three groups of chimpanzees that live in Ivory Coast's Taï National Park. 
The park is one of the last important areas of old-growth tropical forest in West Africa and home to many kinds of plants and animals.
Chimpanzees, along with bonobos, are the closest living relatives to humans. They are intelligent and highly social. 
Chimpanzees make and use tools and can be taught a small amount of human sign language.
Scientists have long known that chimpanzees use different calls, or vocalizations, in the wild. But the new study offered a deeper understanding of their communication.
Cédric Girard-Buttoz was the lead writer of the study that appeared in the publication Communications Biology.
Girard-Buttoz said of the chimpanzee calls, "It is not a language but it is amongst the most complex forms of communication described in a non-human animal."
The call types included what researchers called a grunt, a panted grunt, a hoo sound, a pant hoot, a bark sound, a panted bark, a pant, a scream, a panted scream, a whimper, a panted roar and the non-vocal lip smack and raspberry sounds. 
The researchers determined that these call types were used in 390 different orders or sequences.
"In general 'pant grunt' and 'pant hoot' are the most common calls used in these sequences," Girard-Buttoz said.
The order in which the chimpanzees produced the calls appeared to follow rules, although the study did not include ideas about any possible meanings.
Girard-Buttoz said the study was important because it shows the beginning of communication that could have been the starting point of the evolution toward "syntax in our language."
Syntax is the way in which words are put together to form full sentences or phrases.
The researchers want to learn whether the sequences communicate wider meanings. They have suspicions about the possible meanings of some vocalizations.
Girard-Buttoz said researchers need to “explore in detail” the situations surrounding these calls. 
He added that researchers need to do “playback experiments to see if the suspected meaning matches with the behavioral reaction of chimpanzees when they hear the call."
The researchers are not sure if chimpanzee vocal communication is similar to the beginnings of language in human evolutionary history. 
Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor but split into separate evolutionary families perhaps 7 million years ago.

研究语言进化的科学家说，野生黑猩猩的交流系统比过去的研究显示的要复杂得多。
研究人员说，这种动物使用了十多种呼叫，这些呼叫可以组合成数百个不同的顺序或序列。
研究小组记录了生活在象牙海岸 Taï 国家公园的三组黑猩猩的成员发出的 4,800 次通话录音。
该公园是西非最后几个重要的古老热带森林地区之一，也是多种动植物的家园。
黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩是最接近人类的现存亲属。他们很聪明，社交能力很强。
黑猩猩会制造和使用工具，能学会少量人类手语。
科学家们早就知道黑猩猩在野外使用不同的叫声或发声。但这项新研究让人们更深入地了解了他们的交流方式。
Cédric Girard-Buttoz 是该研究的主要作者，该研究发表在《通讯生物学》杂志上。
Girard-Buttoz 谈到黑猩猩的叫声时说：“它不是一种语言，但它是在非人类动物中描述的最复杂的交流形式之一。”
呼叫类型包括研究人员所说的咕噜声、喘气的咕噜声、呼呼声、喘气声、吠声、喘气的吠声、喘气声、尖叫声、喘气的尖叫声、呜咽声、喘气的咆哮声和没有声音的咂嘴以及呼噜嘴皮子的声音。
研究人员确定这些叫声类型用于 390 种不同的顺序或序列。
“一般来说，'pant grunt' 和 'pant hoot' 是这些序列中最常用的呼叫，”Girard-Buttoz 说。
黑猩猩发出呼叫的顺序似乎遵循规则，尽管该研究没有包括任何可能含义的想法。
Girard-Buttoz 说这项研究很重要，因为它显示了交流的开始，这可能是向“我们的语言语法”演变的起点。
句法是将单词组合在一起形成完整句子或短语的方式。
研究人员想了解这些序列是否传达了更广泛的含义。他们怀疑某些声音的可能含义。
Girard-Buttoz 说，研究人员需要“详细探索”这些电话周围的情况。
他补充说，研究人员需要进行“回放实验，以查看可疑含义是否与黑猩猩听到呼叫时的行为反应相匹配。”
研究人员不确定黑猩猩的声音交流是否类似于人类进化史上语言的起源。
人类和黑猩猩有着共同的祖先，但可能在 700 万年前分裂成独立的进化家族。
