Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher, we will answer a question about the difference between the phrases “as per” and “according to.”
This is Mengwen. I just wanted to know what is the difference between “as per” and “according to” when writing an email. Many thanks in advance. Mengwen
Dear Mengwen, This is a great question.
In some cases, we can use both of these expressions in the same way. ~
But they do have slight differences in tone and formality.
Let’s start with “according to.”
“According to” is described as a preposition in many dictionaries.
“According to” means “as stated by someone or shown by something.” It is usually used at the beginning of a sentence.
Here are some examples:
According to our teacher, the final paper is due before the end of the day.
According to my last email, if we do not schedule the event soon, we will not be able to do so until next year.
It can also mean, “in a way that agrees with.” ~
For this meaning, “according to” can appear in the middle of a sentence. For example:
The teacher divided the class according to age. ~
Any student born before July was put in group A, and anyone born July 1st or after was placed in group B.
The term “according to” is used very generally. ~
The tone or feeling that we get from it is neutral, meaning neither good nor bad. ~
It can be used in both formal and informal situations.
“According to” is used best when we expect something to have happened, or for setting up meetings or completing requests.
This use is most closely related to “as per,” so let's move on to that discussion now.
“As per” means “in accordance with.” The expression combines the adverb “as” with the preposition “per.” Here is an example:
Dear Karen, As per your request, I have listed all of the items that we need to send out by next week.
In this case, it has the same meaning as “according to.” ~
And we can use it in similar situations when we want to point out something previously referenced. ~
But it is best to use “as per” with more formal requests that have specific times and dates.
The term is often used in commercial or business settings.
We can also use just the preposition “per” in the same way, as in this example:
Dear Professor Karen, I handed in the test before the due date, per your instructions.
Both “according to” and “as per” relate to what was previously said or done. ~
“According to” is more general and can be used in different situations. ~
“As per” is more formal and is often used for business, especially with specific due dates and requests.
If you are still unsure about which to use, try thinking of the connotation of each. ~
Connotation is the idea, feeling or association linked to a word or phrase.
Since “according to” is more general and can be used in a lot of different situations, it usually has a neutral connotation.
In recent years, especially with many jobs going online, “as per” is sometimes seen in a more negative way. ~
This has led to many internet memes showing how “as per” is used in emails.
So you might want to choose “according to,” just in case.

你好!本周的“有问必答”节目中，我们将回答一个关于短语“as per”和“according to”之间的区别的问题。
这是Mengwen。我想知道在写电子邮件时“as per”和“according to”有什么区别。先说声谢谢。Mengwen
亲爱的 Mengwen: 这是一个好问题。
在某些情况下，我们可以以相同的方式使用这两个表达式。～
但它们在语气和形式上确实有细微的差别。
让我们从“according to”开始。
“According to”在许多词典中被描述为介词。
“According to”的意思是“就像某人陈述的或某物显示的那样(根据...)”。它通常用在句子的开头。
下面是一些例子:
根据我们老师的说法，期末论文要在今天结束前交。
根据我上一封邮件，如果我们不尽快安排活动，我们要到明年才能安排。
它也可以表示“以一种(大家)同意的方式”。”~
对于这个意思，“according to”可以出现在句子中间。例如:
老师按年龄分组。～
7月之前出生的学生被分到A组，7月1日或之后出生的学生被分到B组。
“according to”这个术语使用得非常普遍。～
我们从中得到的语气或感觉是中性的，意思是既不好也不坏。～
它可以在正式和非正式的情况下使用。
当我们预期某事已经发生，或者安排会议或完成请求时，用“According to”最合适。
这种用法与“as per”最密切相关，所以现在让我们继续讨论这个问题。
“As per”的意思是“按照”。这个短语由副词“as”和介词“per”组成。下面是一个例子:
亲爱的凯伦:根据你的要求，我已经列出了我们需要在下周之前发出的所有物品。
在这种情况下，它与“according to”的意思相同。”~
当我们想要指出以前引用过的东西时，我们可以在类似的情况下使用它。～
但是最好在有具体时间和日期的正式请求中使用“as per”。
这个术语经常在商业或商业环境中使用。
我们也可以用同样的方式使用介词“per”，就像下面这个例子:
尊敬的Karen教授，我按照您的要求在考试截止日期前交了试卷。
“according to”和“as per”都与之前所说或所做的有关。～
“According to”更通用，可以在不同的情况下使用。～
“As per”更为正式，常用于商务场合，特别是在明确的截止日期和请求时。
如果你仍然不确定该用哪个，试着想想每个词的内涵。～
内涵是与一个词或短语相联系的思想、感觉或联想。
因为“according to”更宽泛，可以在很多不同的情况下使用，所以它通常具有中性的含义。
近年来，特别是随着许多工作都在网上进行，“as per”有时被视为一种更消极的方式。～
这导致出现许多网络表情包, 这些表情包描述了“as per”是如何在电子邮件中使用的。
所以为了以防万一, 你可以选择“according to”，。
请让我们知道这些解释是否对你有帮助，Mingwen。
